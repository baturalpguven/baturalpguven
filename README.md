# 🚀 About Me
👋 Hello, World! I'm Baturalp Güven 👨‍💻

Welcome to my GitHub! Here, you'll find a collection of my diverse projects covering various programming languages and fields. As a passionate engineer, I love to explore and experiment with new technologies and solutions.

## 🎓 Education
I recently graduated from Bilkent University with a degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering (EEE). Currently, I am pursuing my M.Sc. in Communications and Electronics Engineering at TUM (Technical University of Munich).


## 💡 Interests
My interests span a wide range of topics, including signal processing, wireless communications, embedded systems, and data science. Particularly, I am deeply fascinated by generative models such as denoising diffusional models (DDPMs) and conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs) the intriguing world of inverse problems.

## 🔧 Tech Stack
I am well-versed in several programming languages, including Python (Pandas, PyTorch, NumPy, Scikit‑learn. etc.), SQL,C++, MATLAB,VHDL, JAVA, LTSpice, DipTrace, Assembly 8051. Additionally, I have experience with tools like TensorFlow, PyTorch Git, and Docker to help me build robust and scalable applications.
